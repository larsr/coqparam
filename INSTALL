            COMPILATION PROCEDURES FOR THE CoqParam SYSTEM
            ----------------------------------------------


WHAT DO YOU NEED ?
==================

   CoqParam is designed to work on computers equipped with a POSIX (Unix
   or a clone) operating system. It is known to work under GNU/Linux
   (i386 and amd64).

   To compile CoqParam, you need:

     - Coq version 8.3, available at http://coq.inria.fr/download

     - Objective Caml version 3.10.0 or later
       (available at http://caml.inria.fr/)

     - Camlp5 (version <= 4.08, or 5.* transitional)

     - GNU Make version 3.81 or later
       (
	available at http://www.gnu.org/software/make/, but also a
        standard or optional add-on part to most Unices and Unix
        clones, sometimes under the name "gmake".

	If a new enough version is not included in your system, nor
        easily available as an add-on, this should get you a working
        make:

	#Download it (wget is an example, use your favourite FTP or HTTP client)
	wget http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/make/make-3.81.tar.bz2
	bzip2 -cd make-3.81.tar.bz2 | tar x
	#If you don't have bzip2, you can download the gzipped version instead.
        cd make-3.81
        ./configure --prefix=${HOME}
	make install

	Then, make sure that ${HOME}/bin is first in your $PATH.
       )


COMPILATION PROCEDURE.
======================

1- Check that you have the Objective Caml compiler version 3.10.0 (or
   later) installed on your computer and that "ocamlopt.opt" and
   "ocamlopt" lie in a directory which is present in your $PATH
   environment variable.

2- Check that you have Camlp5 installed on your computer and that the
   command "camlp5" lies in a directory which is present in your $PATH
   environment variable path.

3- Download Coq version 8.3 and compile and install it by following the
   instructions available in the repository. We recommand that you
   install it on local.

4- Set an environment variable COQBIN to the directory where Coq's
   binaries have been installed; for instance:
     export COQBIN=/home/jdoe/bin/
   (the final slash is mandatory).

5- Compile CoqParam by using the command:
     make
